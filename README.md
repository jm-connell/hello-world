# Overview

{This program is an example of a complete project. It's a template to follow for future projects that I will be adding over the next couple months.}

{This is a Python program that simply displays "Hello World" in the terminal.}

{The reason I created this is to reference for future projects, as well as serve as a proof of concept.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
